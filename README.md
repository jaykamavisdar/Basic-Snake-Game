# Basic-Snake-Game


A simple yet fun implementation of the classic Snake game built with Java and Java Swing & AWT.


**Description**


This is a classic Snake game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game ends if the snake runs into the screen border or into itself. The goal is to eat as much food as possible and achieve the highest score.


**Features**


Simple and intuitive controls (arrow keys)

Score tracking

Snake grows longer as it eats food


Game over when the snake hits the walls or itself

Food spawns randomly on the game board

Smooth gameplay and responsive controls


**Getting Started**

_Prerequisites_

Java 21

Java Swing & AWT library

_Installation_

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jaykamavisdar/Basic-Snake-Game.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Basic-Snake-Game


**How to Play**

_Run the game:_

javac SnakeGame.java

java SnakeGame


Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:

↑ (Up Arrow): Move Up

↓ (Down Arrow): Move Down

← (Left Arrow): Move Left

→ (Right Arrow): Move Right

Try to eat the food (red circles) that appear on the screen to grow your snake and increase your score.

Avoid hitting the walls or running into your own snake body, as this will end the game.



**Future Improvements**

Add different difficulty levels

Include sound effects

Implement a high score system

Add power-ups and obstacles

Create menu screens
